Used permissions:
- Internet: Required to access the local network. This application only communicates in your home network.
- Access network state: Used to decide which network adapters to use (LanXchange only uses local connections like Wifi, never mobile broadband)
- Access wifi state: Used to check Wifi state (to avoid sending anything when Wifi is off)
- Change wifi multicast state: Required for local discovery of other devices without central server
- Wake lock: To keep transfers running and files available when the screen turns off. LanXchange turns itself off if not used to save power.
- Storage: To read and write the transferred files
